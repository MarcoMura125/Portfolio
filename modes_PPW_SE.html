      <h2>Eigenvalue Problems in Physics: From Parallel Plate Waveguides to the Infinite Square Well</h2>

      <div class="project-description">

        <p>
        The same mathematical structures often emerge in different areas of physics, leading to analogous physical behaviors in seemingly unrelated systems.
        In this work, the propagation of electromagnetic modes in parallel plate waveguides is discussed, together with the quantum-mechanical states of a particle confined in an infinite square well.
        The mathematical similarities between the governing equations of these two physical scenarios are then highlighted.
        <br><br>

        
        
        The material presented in the first two sections is based on a synthesis and re-elaboration
        of standard results drawn from the following references:
        <a href="#ref1">[1]</a>, <a href="#ref2">[2]</a>, <a href="#ref3">[3]</a>.
        
        <br><br>
        
        
        The third section contains concluding remarks and personal considerations on the mathematical analogy between waveguide modes and quantum bound states, with particular emphasis on the role of eigenvalue problems and boundary conditions in the discretization of physical quantities.<br><br>

            I. Propagation of Electromagnetic Modes in Parallel-Plate Waveguides
            </span>

            Guided propagation can be described in terms of a translationally invariant structure (also called a <b>cylindrical structure</b> in waveguide theory), 
            i.e. a structure whose electromagnetic properties are invariant along the propagation direction (that we assume to be the z-axis in a three-dimensional Cartesian reference system). The solutions
            of Maxwell's equations in such structures are called <b>modes</b>. Assuming time-harmonic operation with \( e^{j \omega t} \) dependence, modes can be written as

            \[ 
            \vec{E}(x,y,z)=[\vec{e}(x,y)+\hat{z}e_z (x,y)]e^{-j \beta z},
            \tag{1}
            \label{eq:modes1}
            \]

            \[ 
            \vec{H}(x,y,z)=[\vec{h}(x,y)+\hat{z}h_z (x,y)]e^{-j \beta z},
            \tag{2}
            \label{eq:modes2}
            \] 

            where \( \vec{e}(x,y) \) and \( \vec{h}(x,y) \) are the transverse components of the fields, \(e_z (x,y)\) and \(h_z (x,y)\)
            are the longitudinal components, and \(\beta\) is the phase constant of the mode (lossless propagation, \( \alpha = 0\) ).

            Assuming that the propagation occurs in a source free region, we can write Faraday's law and the Ampere-Maxwell law 
            in differential form as:

            \[ 
            \nabla \times \vec{E} = -j \omega \mu \vec{H},
            \tag{3}
            \label{eq:faraday}
            \]

            \[ 
            \nabla \times \vec{H} = j \omega \epsilon \vec{E}, 
            \tag{4}
            \label{eq:ampere}
            \]

            where \(\mu\) and \(\epsilon\) are the permeability and permittivity of the medium, respectively.

            Those equations translate into six partial differential equations for the six components of the electric and magnetic fields.
            For the sake of this analysis (it will be clear in a moment why), we will focus on the two including the x component of the electric field, that are:

            \[ 
            \frac {\partial E_x}{\partial z}-\frac {\partial E_z}{\partial x} = -j \omega \mu H_y, 
            \tag{5}
            \label{eq:5}
            \]

            \[ 
            \frac {\partial H_z}{\partial y}-\frac {\partial H_y}{\partial z} = j \omega \epsilon E_x. 
            \tag{6}
            \label{eq:6}
            \]

            If we consider the \( e^{-j \beta z} \) z dependence of \( E_x \) and \( H_y \), we can rewrite the previous equations as:

            \[ 
            -j \beta E_x - \frac {\partial E_z}{\partial x} = -j \omega \mu H_y, 
            \tag{7}
            \label{eq:7}
            \]

            \[ 
            \frac {\partial H_z}{\partial y} + j \beta H_y = j \omega \epsilon E_x. 
            \tag{8}
            \label{eq:8}
            \]

            If we isolate \( H_y \) from equation \eqref{eq:7} and substitute it into equation \eqref{eq:8}, we can obtain an expression for \( E_x \) 
            in terms of the longitudinal components of the fields:

            \[
            \ E_x = \frac {-j}{k_c^2} \left( \beta \frac {\partial E_z}{\partial x} + \omega \mu \frac {\partial H_z}{\partial y} \right),
            \tag{9}
            \label{eq:9}
            \]

            where we have defined \( k_c^2 = k^2 - \beta ^2 \) with \( k = \omega \sqrt{\mu \epsilon} \) being the wave number of the medium. 
            \( k_c \) is called <b>cutoff wave number</b>. <br><br>

            Waveguides support <b>transverse electric (TE)</b> modes and/or  <b>transverse magnetic (TM)</b> modes. In TE modes, the longitudinal component of the electric field is zero
            ( \( E_z = 0 \) ), while in TM modes the longitudinal component of the magnetic field is zero ( \( H_z = 0 \) ). Transverse electromagnetic (TEM) modes, for which both longitudinal
            field components vanish, are supported only by waveguides with at least two conductors, such as parallel-plate or coaxial waveguides. <br><br>
            We restrict the analysis here to TE modes, so that equation \eqref{eq:9} becomes:

            \[
            \ E_x = \frac {-j \omega \mu}{k_c^2} \frac {\partial H_z}{\partial y}.
            \tag{10}
            \label{eq:10}
            \]

            To further proceed, we need to find an expression for \(H_z\). We can do it from the scalar Helmholtz wave equation (in a homogeneous, source-free medium) for the longitudinal components of the magnetic field:

            \[
            \ \left( \frac {\partial ^2}{\partial x^2} + \frac {\partial ^2}{\partial y^2} + \frac {\partial ^2}{\partial z^2} + k^2 \right) H_z = 0.
            \tag{11}
            \label{eq:11}
            \]

            Since \( H_z(x,y,z) = h_z(x,y) e^{-j \beta z} \) and \( k_c^2 = k^2 - \beta ^2 \), we can rewrite equation \eqref{eq:11} as:

            \[
            \ \left( \frac {\partial ^2}{\partial x^2} + \frac {\partial ^2}{\partial y^2} + k_c^2 \right) h_z = 0.
            \tag{12}
            \label{eq:12}
            \]

            Let's consider now a <b>parallel plate waveguide (PPW)</b> made of two infinite perfectly conducting plates
            separated by a distance \( d \) along the y axis. Since \( d \) is assumed to be very small compared to the other dimensions of the waveguide,
            any variation of the fields along the x axis can be neglected ( \( h_z(x,y) = h_z(y) \) ).
            Therefore, equation \eqref{eq:12} becomes:

            \[
            \ \left( \frac {d ^2}{d y^2} + k_c^2 \right) h_z(y) = 0.
            \tag{13}
            \label{eq:13}
            \]

            Equation \eqref{eq:13} can be rearranged as:

            \[
            \ -\frac { d ^2 h_z(y)}{d y^2} =  k_c^2 h_z(y).
            \tag{14}
            \label{eq:14}
            \]

            Please note that equation \eqref{eq:14} is an eigenvalue equation, where \( h_z(y) \) is the eigenfunction and \( k_c^2 \) is the eigenvalue.
            The general solution of equation \eqref{eq:14} is:

            \[
            \ h_z(y) = A \sin(k_c y) + B \cos(k_c y),
            \tag{15}
            \label{eq:15}
            \]

            where A and B are constants to be determined by the boundary conditions. <br>
            The general expression of the tangential component of the magnetic field is then given by:

            \[
            \ H_z(x,y,z) = \left( A \sin(k_c y) + B \cos(k_c y) \right) e^{-j \beta z}.
            \tag{16}
            \label{eq:16}
            \]

            From equation \eqref{eq:10}, we can write the expression of the component \( E_x \) of the electric field as:

            \[
            \ E_x = \frac {-j \omega \mu}{k_c} \left( A \cos(k_c y) - B \sin(k_c y) \right) e^{-j \beta z}.
            \tag{17}
            \label{eq:17}
            \]

            Since the plates of the waveguide are assumed to be perfect conductors, \( E_x \) must be zero at the boundaries ( \( y = 0 \) and \( y = d \) ).

            Applying the boundary conditions to equation \eqref{eq:17}, we obtain that \( A = 0 \) and that \( k_c \) must satisfy the following condition:

            \[
            \ k_c=\frac {n \pi}{d}, \quad n = 1, 2, 3, ...
            \tag{18}
            \label{eq:18}
            \]

            Therefore, within the PPW defined above, equation \eqref{eq:14} admits only a discrete set of eigenvalues.
            The corresponding eigenfunctions are given by:

            \[
            \ h_z(y) = B_n \cos\left(\frac {n \pi}{d} y\right), \quad n = 1, 2, 3, ...
            \tag{19}  
            \label{eq:19}
            \]

            and the tangential component \( H_z \) of the magnetic field can be written as:

            \[
            \ H_z(x,y) = B_n \cos\left(\frac {n \pi}{d} y\right) e^{-j \beta z}.
            \tag{20}  
            \label{eq:20}
            \]

            It can be verified that the corresponding transverse fields are:

            \[
            \ E_x = \frac {j \omega \mu}{k_c}B_n \sin\left(\frac {n \pi}{d} y\right) e^{-j \beta z},
            \tag{21}  
            \label{eq:21}
            \]

            \[
            \ H_y = \frac {j \beta}{k_c}B_n \sin\left(\frac {n \pi}{d} y\right) e^{-j \beta z},
            \tag{22}  
            \label{eq:22}
            \]

            \[
            \ E_y=H_x=0.
            \tag{23}  
            \label{eq:23}
            \]

            The phase constant \( \beta \) of the \( TE_n \) mode is given by:

            \[ 
            \ \beta_n = \sqrt{k^2 - \left(\frac {n \pi}{d}\right)^2}.
            \tag{24}  
            \label{eq:24}
            \]

            In order for the mode to propagate, \( \beta_n \) must be real, which implies that the following condition must be satisfied:

            \[ 
            \ k > \frac {n \pi}{d}.
            \tag{25}
            \label{eq:25}
            \]

            The condition expressed by equation \eqref{eq:25} defines a <b>cutoff frequency</b> for each mode, given by:

            \[
            \ f_{c_n} = \frac {n }{2 d \sqrt{\mu \epsilon}}.
            \tag{26}
            \label{eq:26}
            \]

            A similar analysis can be carried out for TM modes, leading to the same cutoff frequency and phase constant expressions as in equation \eqref{eq:25} and \eqref{eq:26}. <br><br>

            Below the cutoff frequency, the mode is evanescent and cannot propagate. Above the cutoff frequency, the mode can propagate with a phase constant given by equation \eqref{eq:24}. <br><br>
            The analysis above shows that the modes in a parallel plates waveguide are discretized due to the boundary conditions imposed by the conducting plates.
            This discretization leads to a set of allowed modes, each characterized by a specific cutoff frequency and field distribution. <br><br>

            II. Quantum Confinement in the Infinite Square Well
            </span>
            Let's now consider the quantum mechanical analog of the PPW, i.e. the <b>infinite square well (ISW)</b>.
            The ISW is a one-dimensional potential well defined by:

            \[ 
            \ V(x) = \begin{cases}  
            0, & 0 < x < a \\
            \infty, & \text{elsewhere}
            \end{cases}
            \tag{27}
            \label{eq:27}
            \]

            where \( a \) is the width of the well. The time-independent Schrödinger equation for a particle of mass \( m \) inside the ISW (where \( V(x)=0 \)) is given by:

            \[ 
            \ -\frac {\hbar ^2}{2m} \frac {d^2 \psi (x)}{dx^2}  = E \psi (x),
            \tag{28}
            \label{eq:28}
            \]

            where \( \psi (x) \) is the wavefunction of the particle, \( E \) is the energy , and \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck constant. <br><br>

            Equation \eqref{eq:28} can be rearranged as:

            \[ 
            \ -\frac {d^2 \psi (x)}{dx^2} = k^2 \psi (x),
            \tag{29}
            \label{eq:29}
            \]
            where \( k = \sqrt{\frac {2mE}{\hbar ^2}} \) (E is assumed to be non negative). <br><br>
            Note that equation \eqref{eq:29} is an eigenvalue equation, where \( \psi (x) \) is the eigenfunction and \( k^2 \) is the eigenvalue,
            mathematically equivalent, up to a change of physical interpretation, to \eqref{eq:14} for the PPW. The general solution of equation \eqref{eq:29} can then be written in the form:

            \[ 
            \ \psi (x) = A \sin(k x) + B \cos(k x),
            \tag{30}
            \label{eq:30}
            \]

            where A and B are constants to be determined by the boundary conditions. <br>

            Since outside the well \( \psi (x) \) must be zero (infinite potential) and the wavefunction must be continuous, we have that \( \psi (0) = 0 \) and \( \psi (a) = 0 \).
            Applying these boundary conditions to equation \eqref{eq:30}, we obtain that \( B = 0 \) and that \( k \) must satisfy the following condition:

            \[ 
            \ k=\frac {n \pi}{a}, \quad n = 1, 2, 3, ...
            \tag{31}
            \label{eq:31}
            \]

            Therefore, within the ISW defined above, equation \eqref{eq:29} admits only a discrete set of eigenvalues and hence of allowed energy values, given by:

            \[
            \ E_n = \frac {n^2 \pi ^2 \hbar ^2}{2 m a^2}, \quad n = 1, 2, 3, ...
            \tag{32}
            \label{eq:32}
            \]

            The corresponding eigenfunctions are:

            \[
            \ \psi(x) = A_n \sin\left(\frac {n \pi}{a} x\right), \quad n = 1, 2, 3, ...
            \tag{33}
            \label{eq:33}
            \]
            where \( A_n \) are normalization constants. <br><br>

            The analysis above shows that the allowed energy values in an infinite square well are discretized due to the boundary conditions imposed by the infinite potential walls.

            III. Mathematical Analogy Between Waveguide Modes and Quantum Bound States
            </span>
            
            Even though the physical contexts and interpretations are different, both the PPW and the ISW exhibit a discretization of modes.
            This behavior originates from the mathematical structure of the governing equations.
            Equations \eqref{eq:14} and \eqref{eq:29} are mathematically analogous eigenvalue equations, and similar equations appear in many different areas of physics and engineering.
            Perhaps the most famous example is the equation of motion of the harmonic oscillator, but there are many others.
            See, for example, the discussion presented <a href="Warburg.html" target="_blank">here</a>, where a similar equation arises in the derivation of the electrochemical impedance for linear semi-infinite diffusion.
            In some systems, such as a vibrating string fixed at both ends, boundary conditions lead to the discretization of specific physical quantities, namely the allowed vibration frequencies.

            More precisely, equations \eqref{eq:14} and \eqref{eq:29}, together with their boundary conditions, define
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturm%E2%80%93Liouville_theory" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sturm–Liouville</a> problems.
            Considering the Hilbert space of square-integrable functions defined over a closed interval, the problems discussed here can be formulated as eigenvalue problems for self-adjoint differential operators.
            It can be shown that, in both cases (PPW and ISW), the eigenfunctions can be chosen to form a complete orthonormal set in the corresponding Hilbert space.
            Orthonormality means that the following condition holds:

            \[
            \int_{y_1}^{y_2} f_m^*(y)\, f_n(y)\, dy = \delta_{mn},
            \tag{34}
            \label{eq:34}
            \]

            where \( f_n(y) \) and \( f_m(y) \) are eigenfunctions associated with different eigenvalues,
            \( y_1 \) and \( y_2 \) denote the boundaries of the interval, and \( \delta_{mn} \) is the Kronecker delta.
            Here, \( y \) represents a generic spatial variable over the relevant domain.
            Completeness implies that any square-integrable function defined on the interval can be expressed as a linear combination of the eigenfunctions.<br><br>

            This work does not aim to be a rigorous mathematical treatise.
            Rather, its goal is to highlight how mathematical structures can provide a unifying framework for describing seemingly different physical phenomena.
            Recognizing such analogies makes it possible to transfer intuition and methods from one field to another, facilitating problem-solving and fostering
            a deeper understanding of the principles underlying a wide range of physical systems. This is fascinating to observe.
